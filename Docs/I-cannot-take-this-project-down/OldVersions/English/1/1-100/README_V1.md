# Reasons why I can't take this project down

Despite all the embarrassment associated with it, I can't take it down, because:

* It is a preparation step for the future release of the life archive project

* It contains effort

* 9+ forks depend on this project

* The information is online and can't come down, I need to maintain ownership

* The project can be multi-purposed

* Privating the project does nothing, it can still be leaked

* List more reasons here
